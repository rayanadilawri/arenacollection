Project 4: Links

Original Curator: Ziwei Xing

My role in this project was to Assist curation for the arena channel: Plants in Art and Literature: Nature's Inspiration. I used an API and Javascript template given to me by my professors to build this system. I then created the HTML and CSS to design my collection in a way that resembles the topic.

Design Strategy: I decided to emualte monet's water lillies for my project as to me, they are the opitomy of plants in art/design. I wanted to translate this idea fro ma painting to coding to make the design seem realistic and make the theme evident.
